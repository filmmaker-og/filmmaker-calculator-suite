## 🎯 How to Use This Documentation

### The Design System Reference Guide

**What it is:**
- A comprehensive reference of modern UI/UX best practices (2026 standards)
- Inspiration and patterns from industry-leading apps
- Technical implementation examples

**What it is NOT:**
- Not a rulebook — use discretion
- Not mandatory for every feature
- Not a replacement for user testing

**When to use it:**
- Starting a new feature and need design direction
- Evaluating third-party UI libraries
- Making decisions about navigation, layout, or interactions
- Looking for modern patterns (glass effects, bottom nav, micro-interactions)

**When to ignore it:**
- When user research suggests a different approach
- When technical constraints require adaptation
- When your specific use case demands custom solutions
- When speed matters more than perfection

### Decision Framework

```
User needs → Research → Design System Reference → Your Judgment → Ship
              ↑                                          ↓
              └──────────────── Iterate ────────────────┘
```

**The hierarchy:**
1. **User needs** (always #1)
2. **Brand guidelines** (maintain consistency)
3. **Design system reference** (consult for ideas)
4. **Your expertise** (final call)

## 💡 Design Philosophy

> "Premium but Humble"

We're building institutional-grade tools that feel approachable. Think: a trusted advisor who happens to dress well.

**Core Principles:**
1. **User needs over design trends** — Trends inspire, users decide
2. **Consistency over novelty** — Boring is beautiful if it works
3. **Accessibility is non-negotiable** — Everyone deserves access
4. **Speed matters** — Fast feels professional, slow feels broken

## ⚖️ When Guidelines Conflict

**If Design System conflicts with User Research:**
→ User research wins. Document why in the PR.

**If Design System conflicts with Technical Constraints:**
→ Technical reality wins. Adapt the pattern and document the decision.

**If Design System conflicts with Brand Guidelines:**
→ Brand guidelines win. Always maintain brand consistency.

**If unsure:**
→ Ship MVP, test with users, iterate based on data.
